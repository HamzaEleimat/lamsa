# 🔴 EXPOSED KEYS vs ✅ FIXED CONFIGURATION

## 1. Supabase Service Key (CRITICAL!)

### 🔴 WHAT WAS EXPOSED (in .env.backup):
```
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.[REDACTED_FOR_SECURITY]
```
⚠️ This key gives FULL DATABASE ACCESS - anyone with this key can read/write/delete ALL data!

### ✅ NOW FIXED (in current .env):
```
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=
```
✅ The key has been removed and must now be set as an environment variable

---

## 2. JWT Secret

### 🔴 WHAT WAS EXPOSED:
```
JWT_SECRET=lamsa-jwt-secret-2024
```
⚠️ This predictable secret could allow attackers to forge authentication tokens

### ✅ NOW FIXED:
```
JWT_SECRET=CHANGE_ME_IN_PRODUCTION_e59q2RC6dYMG1pOD2xTUBXDB34zTuR+j6AhC2iqSunA=
```
✅ Replaced with cryptographically secure random secret

---

## 3. Authentication Tokens

### 🔴 FILES THAT WERE TRACKED IN GIT:
```
lamsa-api/customer_token.txt
lamsa-api/provider_token.txt  
lamsa-api/otp.txt
```
⚠️ These contained actual JWT tokens and OTP codes

### ✅ NOW FIXED:
- Files deleted from filesystem
- Removed from git tracking
- Added to .gitignore to prevent future exposure

---

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:

### 🚨 1. ROTATE YOUR SUPABASE SERVICE KEY NOW!

```bash
# 1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/libwbqgceovhknljmuvh/settings/api
# 2. Find "service_role" section
# 3. Click "Roll" button to generate new key
# 4. Copy the new key
```

### 🔧 2. SET UP ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE (Linux/Mac):

```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
echo 'export SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY="your-new-service-key-here"' >> ~/.bashrc

# Reload your shell
source ~/.bashrc
```

### 🔧 3. FOR WINDOWS (PowerShell):

```powershell
# Set for current session
$env:SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY="your-new-service-key-here"

# Set permanently
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY", "your-new-service-key-here", "User")
```

### 📦 4. COMMIT THE FIXES:

```bash
cd /home/hamza/lamsa
git status                # See what's ready
git commit -m "Security: Remove exposed service keys and add security measures"
git push origin main
```

### 🧹 5. CLEAN GIT HISTORY (if already pushed):

The exposed key is still in your git history! Use BFG to remove it:

```bash
# Download BFG
wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/madgag/bfg/1.14.0/bfg-1.14.0.jar

# Remove the .env file from history
java -jar bfg-1.14.0.jar --delete-files .env

# Clean up
git reflog expire --expire=now --all
git gc --prune=now --aggressive

# Force push
git push --force
