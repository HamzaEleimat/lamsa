# Expo Notifications Warning Information

## Warning Messages
```
WARN  expo-notifications: Android Push notifications (remote notifications) functionality provided by expo-notifications was removed from Expo Go with the release of SDK 53. Use a development build instead of Expo Go.
WARN  `expo-notifications` functionality is not fully supported in Expo Go:
We recommend you instead use a development build to avoid limitations.
```

## What This Means

Starting with Expo SDK 53, push notifications are no longer supported in Expo Go. This is not an error in your code, but a limitation of the development environment.

## Solutions

### For Development
1. **Continue using Expo Go** - Local notifications will still work, but remote push notifications won't. This is fine for most development work.

2. **Use a Development Build** - If you need to test push notifications:
   ```bash
   # Install EAS CLI
   npm install -g eas-cli
   
   # Configure your project
   eas build:configure
   
   # Create a development build
   eas build --profile development --platform android
   eas build --profile development --platform ios
   ```

### For Production
Production builds will have full push notification support. This warning only affects development with Expo Go.

## Current Implementation

The app already has push notification setup in place:
- Permission handling in `src/utils/platform/permissions.ts`
- Notification services configured
- Will work properly in production builds

## No Action Required

This warning can be safely ignored during development unless you specifically need to test push notifications.
