# Authentication Debug Findings

## Summary
The provider authentication is working correctly at the service level but failing at the API endpoint level.

## Key Findings

### 1. Direct Authentication Works âœ…
- Direct Supabase login: **Works**
- `auth.signInProvider` method: **Works**
- Provider record exists and is properly linked

### 2. Test Results
- **Provider Account**: `provider@example.com` / `Provider123!`
- **Direct signInProvider call**: Returns correct user and provider data
- **API endpoint call**: Returns "Invalid email or password"

### 3. Debug Logs Added
1. Controller method logs email and auth result
2. signInProvider method logs all steps
3. Both show the method works when called directly

### 4. Issue Location
The problem is in the controller at line 547:
```typescript
if (authError || !authResult) {
  // This condition is true when it shouldn't be
  throw new AppError(
    `Invalid email or password. ${lockoutResult.remainingAttempts} attempts remaining.`,
    401
  );
}
```

### 5. Possible Causes
1. **Import/Module Issue**: The `auth` object might be different when imported in the controller
2. **Async/Promise Issue**: The promise might not be resolving correctly
3. **Middleware Interference**: Something might be modifying the request/response
4. **Environment Variables**: Different env vars when running the server vs scripts

### 6. Current Status
- Account is now locked due to too many attempts
- Need to wait 15 minutes or reset the lockout
- Server console logs would show the exact issue

## Next Steps
1. Check server console for debug output
2. Reset the account lockout
3. Verify the auth import is consistent
4. Test with a fresh account to avoid lockout issues

## Workaround
For now, create new test accounts using:
```bash
npx ts-node create-working-provider.ts
```

Then test with those credentials.
