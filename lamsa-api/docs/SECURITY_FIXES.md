# Security Fixes Documentation

## 1. PII_ENCRYPTION_KEY Required in All Environments

### Issue
PII_ENCRYPTION_KEY was auto-generated in development environments, leading to:
- Data loss on server restart
- Inconsistent encryption between environments
- Potential for developers to accidentally deploy without proper encryption

### Solution Implemented
1. **Updated Encryption Service** (`src/services/encryption.service.ts`)
   - Removed auto-generation of temporary keys
   - Always throws error if PII_ENCRYPTION_KEY is missing

2. **Enhanced Environment Validation** (`src/utils/environment-validation.ts`)
   - Added PII_ENCRYPTION_KEY as required variable
   - Added comprehensive key validation:
     - Must be valid base64
     - Must decode to exactly 32 bytes (256 bits)
     - Must have sufficient entropy
     - Cannot contain weak patterns

3. **Updated .env.example**
   - Added PII_ENCRYPTION_KEY with clear instructions
   - Added warning about backing up the key

4. **Created Key Generation Script** (`scripts/generate-secure-keys.js`)
   - Run with: `npm run generate:keys`
   - Generates cryptographically secure keys
   - Optionally saves to .env.generated

### Security Benefits
- Ensures all environments use proper encryption
- Prevents accidental data loss
- Enforces strong key requirements
- Makes encryption configuration explicit

## 2. Removed Deprecated csurf Package

### Issue
The deprecated `csurf` package was listed as a dependency but not actually used in the codebase.

### Solution Implemented
1. **Removed unused dependency**
   - Ran `npm uninstall csurf`
   - Application already has custom CSRF implementation

2. **Verified custom implementation** (`src/middleware/csrf.middleware.ts`)
   - Uses secure double-submit cookie pattern
   - Cryptographically secure token generation (32 bytes)
   - Timing-safe comparison to prevent timing attacks
   - Proper cookie settings (SameSite=strict, Secure in production)

### Security Benefits
- Removes potential vulnerability from deprecated package
- Custom implementation is more secure and tailored to application needs
- No breaking changes as csurf wasn't actually used

## 3. Removed unsafe-inline from CSP in Production

### Issue
Content Security Policy allowed `unsafe-inline` for scripts and styles, which weakens XSS protection.

### Solution Implemented
1. **Conditional CSP based on environment** (`src/app.ts`)
   - `unsafe-inline` only allowed in development (for Swagger UI)
   - Strict CSP in production with no inline scripts/styles

2. **Conditional Swagger loading**
   - Swagger UI disabled by default in production
   - Can be enabled with `ENABLE_SWAGGER=true` if needed
   - Returns 404 for Swagger endpoints in production

### Security Benefits
- Prevents XSS attacks via inline script injection in production
- Reduces attack surface by disabling Swagger in production
- Maintains developer convenience in development environment

## 4. Provider Phone Number Encryption

### Issue
Provider phone numbers were stored in plaintext in the database, exposing PII in case of a database breach.

### Solution Implemented
1. **Updated Provider Controller** (`src/controllers/provider.controller.ts`)
   - Modified `createProvider()` to use `encryptedDb.createProvider()` instead of direct Supabase calls
   - Modified `updateProvider()` to use `encryptedDb.updateProvider()` for PII encryption
   - Modified `getProviderById()` to use `encryptedDb.getProviderProfile()` which handles decryption based on authorization

2. **Enhanced Encrypted Database Service** (`src/services/encrypted-db.service.ts`)
   - Added `updateProvider()` method to handle encrypted updates
   - Added `findProviderByPhone()` method for secure phone lookups using hash
   - Provider PII fields encrypted: `owner_name`, `email`, `phone`, `address`, `bank_account_number`

3. **Updated Auth Controller** (`src/controllers/auth.controller.ts`)
   - Modified provider signup to use `encryptedDb.findProviderByPhone()` for duplicate checking
   - Modified provider phone verification to use encrypted lookups

4. **Database Migration** (`supabase/migrations/20250122000003_encrypt_provider_phones.sql`)
   - Added columns: `pii_encrypted`, `pii_encrypted_at`, `phone_hash`, `email_hash`
   - Added indexes on hash columns for performance

5. **Migration Script** (`src/scripts/migrate-provider-encryption.ts`)
   - Created script to encrypt existing provider data
   - Run with: `npm run migrate:provider-encryption`

### How It Works
- All provider PII is encrypted using AES-256-GCM with field-specific keys
- Phone and email are hashed using HMAC-SHA256 for secure lookups
- Public access shows masked PII (e.g., `****1234` for phone)
- Full PII is only decrypted for authorized users (provider owner or admin)

### Migration Steps
1. Ensure `PII_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is set in environment
2. Run database migration: `supabase db push`
3. Encrypt existing data: `npm run migrate:provider-encryption`

### Security Benefits
- Provider PII is protected at rest
- Secure lookups without exposing plaintext
- Field-level encryption allows granular access control
- Audit trail via `pii_encrypted_at` timestamp
