# 

This document outlines the font guidelines for our women's beauty booking mobile application, ensuring a consistent, elegant, and user-friendly experience. The selected fonts aim to convey sophistication and readability, aligning with the app's aesthetic and purpose.

# 

# Font Selection

# 

Our mobile app utilizes two distinct fonts, each serving a specific purpose to enhance readability and visual appeal.

* Headings: Cormorant Garamond  
* Body Text: Martel Sans

  ## Cormorant Garamond: Headings

# 

Cormorant Garamond is a classic and elegant serif typeface, chosen for its sophisticated appearance. It will be used for all headings within the application, including screen titles, section headers, and important call-to-action titles.

# 

### Key Characteristics:

* Elegance: Its refined serifs and balanced proportions convey a sense of luxury and professionalism.  
* Readability: Despite its decorative nature, it maintains good readability at larger sizes, making it suitable for headings.  
* Brand Alignment: Perfectly complements the beauty industry's focus on aesthetics and high-quality experiences.

  ### Usage Guidelines for Cormorant Garamond:

* Size: Headings should be prominent and scaled appropriately for different screen sizes (e.g., larger for main screen titles, slightly smaller for section headers).  
  * Main Screen Titles (e.g., App Home Screen): 28-32pt  
  * Section Headers (e.g., "Services," "My Bookings"): 20-24pt  
  * Call-to-Action Titles: 18-22pt  
* Weight: Primarily used in Regular or SemiBold weights to ensure clarity and impact. Bold weights should be reserved for critical alerts or very prominent titles.  
  * Regular: For standard headings.  
  * SemiBold: For emphasizing important section headers.  
  * Bold: For critical alerts or highly prominent titles (use sparingly).  
* Color: Headings should generally be in a dark, easily readable color that contrasts well with the background. Brand-specific accent colors can be used sparingly for visual emphasis.  
  * Primary Heading Color: \#212121 (Dark Gray)  
  * Accent Color (for emphasis): \[Insert Brand Accent Color Hex Code, e.g., \#FF6B81\]  
* Letter Spacing (Tracking): \-0.02em to 0em, to maintain legibility and elegance, avoiding overly tight or loose letterforms.  
* Line Height (Leading): 1.2 to 1.3 times the font size for multi-line headings to ensure adequate spacing.  
* Capitalization: Typically Title Case (e.g., "Book Your Appointment").  
* Alignment: Left-aligned by default, center-aligned for specific hero sections or prominent calls to action.

  ## Martel Sans: Body Text

# 

Martel Sans is a modern and clean sans-serif typeface, selected for all body text within the application. Its straightforward design ensures high readability across various text lengths, from descriptions and appointment details to user reviews and terms and conditions.

# 

### Key Characteristics:

* Clarity: Its simple, unadorned letterforms make it exceptionally clear and easy to read on digital screens.  
* Modernity: A contemporary feel that balances the classic elegance of Cormorant Garamond, creating a harmonious visual identity.  
* Versatility: Performs well at smaller sizes, which is crucial for mobile app content where screen real estate is limited.

  ### Usage Guidelines for Martel Sans:

* Size: Body text should be legible at standard reading distances. A comfortable minimum font size should be established and consistently applied across the app.  
  * Standard Body Text: 14-16pt  
  * Smaller Legal/Ancillary Text: 12-13pt (e.g., terms & conditions, disclaimers)  
* Weight: Primarily used in Regular weight for general text. Bold can be used for emphasizing specific words or short phrases within body text.  
  * Regular: For general paragraph text, descriptions, and details.  
  * Bold: For highlighting keywords, prices, or important information within sentences.  
* Color: Body text should be in a color that provides strong contrast with the background to minimize eye strain. Avoid overly light or dark colors that might blend in.  
  * Primary Body Text Color: \#424242 (Medium Gray)  
  * Secondary Text Color (for less prominent info): \#757575 (Light Gray)  
* Letter Spacing (Tracking): 0em to 0.02em, to ensure clear separation of characters, especially at smaller sizes.  
* Line Spacing (Leading): Adequate line spacing (leading) should be maintained to improve text flow and readability, preventing text from appearing cramped. Aim for 1.5 to 1.6 times the font size.  
* Capitalization: Sentence case for standard body text.  
* Alignment: Left-aligned for optimal readability in long passages.

  ## Font Pairing and Hierarchy

# 

  The combination of Cormorant Garamond for headings and Martel Sans for body text creates a clear visual hierarchy, guiding the user's eye and improving information digestion.

* Headings (Cormorant Garamond): Clearly indicate the start of new sections or important information.  
* Body Text (Martel Sans): Provides detailed information in a clear and accessible format.  
  Consistent application of these guidelines is paramount for a cohesive and professional user experience within the mobile app. Regular reviews should be conducted to ensure adherence and optimize readability as the app evolves.
