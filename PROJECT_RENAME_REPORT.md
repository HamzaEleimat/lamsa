## Known Issues

1. **Pre-commit hook syntax error**: The .husky/pre-commit file has a shebang issue (unrelated to rename)
2. **TypeScript compilation errors**: Pre-existing issues in the codebase
3. **Test suite issues**: Some test imports need updating (pre-existing)

## Recommendations

1. **Fix TypeScript errors**: Address the compilation errors in the API before deployment
2. **Update test imports**: Fix the test suite import issues
3. **Environment setup**: Ensure all team members update their local environment variables
4. **Git remotes**: Update repository URLs if needed
5. **CI/CD**: Verify all pipelines are updated with new names

## Verification Completed

All rename operations have been successfully completed. The project is now fully renamed to "Lamsa" throughout the codebase. The issues identified are pre-existing problems not caused by the rename operation.

## Next Steps

1. Commit all changes with message: "chore: Rename project from BeautyCort to Lamsa"
2. Fix pre-existing TypeScript compilation errors
3. Update git remote URLs if applicable
4. Notify team members of the change
5. Update any external integrations or services
