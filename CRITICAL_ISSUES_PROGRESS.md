# Critical Issues Progress Report

## Summary
We've successfully addressed two of the three critical issues identified in the codebase analysis. Here's the current status:

## 1. ✅ Image Storage Bottleneck - COMPLETED

### What Was Done:
- Created comprehensive image storage service using Supabase Storage with pre-signed URLs
- Implemented complete image upload/validation/deletion endpoints
- Created migration script for existing base64 images in database
- Set up storage buckets with proper RLS policies
- Reduced API body parser limit from 10MB to 1MB

### Key Files Created/Modified:
- `/lamsa-api/src/services/image-storage.service.ts` - Complete implementation
- `/lamsa-api/src/controllers/image.controller.ts` - RESTful endpoints
- `/lamsa-api/src/routes/image.routes.ts` - Route configuration
- `/lamsa-api/scripts/migrate-base64-images.ts` - Migration script
- `/database/setup-storage-buckets.sql` - Storage bucket setup
- `/docs/IMAGE_STORAGE_MIGRATION.md` - Migration documentation

### Benefits:
- Direct client-to-storage uploads (bypasses API)
- Reduced database size and query performance impact
- Better scalability for image-heavy operations
- CDN-ready with Supabase Storage

## 2. ✅ Automated Testing Framework - COMPLETED

### What Was Done:
- Set up Jest with TypeScript support
- Created unit tests for critical business logic:
  - Fee calculation service (19 tests, all passing)
  - Booking errors and state machine (29 tests, all passing)
- Configured test scripts for unit/integration separation
- Fixed TypeScript and Jest configuration issues

### Key Files Created:
- `/lamsa-api/jest.config.simple.js` - Jest configuration
- `/lamsa-api/tests/unit/services/fee-calculation.service.test.ts` - Fee tests
- `/lamsa-api/tests/unit/types/booking-errors.test.ts` - Error tests
- `/lamsa-api/tests/minimal-setup.ts` - Test environment setup
- Updated `tsconfig.json` to include Jest types

### Current State:
- 48 tests passing across 2 test suites
- Framework is operational and ready for additional tests
- Integration tests written but need database setup fixes
- Some older unit tests need updates for API changes

## 3. ⏳ Stateful Token Management - PENDING

### What Needs to Be Done:
- Implement Redis for distributed token blacklisting
- Replace in-memory Maps in auth middleware
- Add proper token refresh rotation
- Remove hardcoded JWT fallback secret

### Prerequisites:
- Redis is already installed and configured
- Connection test scripts exist: `npm run test:redis`
- Environment variables configured for Redis URL

## Next Immediate Steps:

1. **Complete Token Management Refactoring**
   - Priority: HIGH
   - Implement Redis-based token blacklist
   - Add distributed session management
   - Ensure horizontal scaling capability

2. **Fix Remaining Test Issues**
   - Priority: MEDIUM
   - Update tests for current API structure
   - Fix TypeScript compilation errors in tests
   - Add more coverage for critical paths

3. **Security Hardening**
   - Priority: MEDIUM
   - Remove JWT fallback secret
   - Add rate limiting to auth endpoints
   - Implement proper secret rotation

## Commands for Testing:
```bash
# Run unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Run specific test file
npm test -- --config jest.config.simple.js tests/unit/services/fee-calculation.service.test.ts

# Check Redis connection
npm run test:redis

# Run image migration (when ready)
npm run migrate:images
```

## Environment Requirements:
- Supabase Storage buckets must be created (run setup-storage-buckets.sql)
- Redis must be running for token management implementation
- Test environment variables configured in .env.test
